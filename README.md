# LoanRepaymentCalculator
Loan Repayment Calculator Software

Course Project for Cs degree. 

Encoperates some best practices for Software engineering in Java.

Some decent examples of my code. 

 Few persistant errors in a few of the other UI panes. 

Fun little project still deciding where to spend my time and whether or not I would like to polish this up.

Notes for things to fiX:
-Comments could use a bit more detail
-Presistant error within the "Create Account UI"
-Cleaner way to inform user of Minimum requierments for editable fields.
-Darker theme for the backround. 
-Fill empty space on the Master Loan List
-Known Issues with the "Sort By" drop down meanu on the "Master Loan List"
-Impliment better description within the "payment calculator"
-Some issues with payment methods 
-need to impliment more payment methods
